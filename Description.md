# StudentData
Analyzed student data (enrollment, engagement, submission) using data analysis techniques for an online course to compare how the students who passed the first project differ from those who did not.

1. Acquired data in csv format.
2. Cleaned the data (removed test data and fixed data types from string format to relevant formats like integer/date/boolean as required, also normalized key data types across the data).
3. Explored the data to understand connections between the data. Decided to explore the data for paid students from the first week of engagement.
4. Used descriptive statistics and histograms to observe and compare data from students who passed first project and those who did not.
